Gammu for Windows
=================

This directory contains some examples of using Gammu on Windows. They
are not maintained and most likely are broken. If nobody will interest
in maintaining them, they will be removed in future.

Please note that Gammu itself can be compiled on Windows using CMake[1],
which can be used to generate native projects for Microsoft Visual
Studio or Borland. For more details see INSTALL file in top level
directory.
