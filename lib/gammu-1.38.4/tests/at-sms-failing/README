Test cases for AT SMS engine
============================

All test data here was collected from randomly available sources on the
Internet. I just entered 'gammu "AT+CMGR"' to Google and picked some
random results. If you think that some included message breaks your
copyright or other rights, just drop me a note.

Tests in this directory collect invalid messages and Gammu is supposed
to fail correctly on parsing those.
